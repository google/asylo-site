Asylo is an open framework for developing enclave applications. Asylo lets you
take advantage of a range of emerging trusted execution environments, including
both software and hardware isolation technologies.

Asylo provides:

+   The ability to execute trusted workloads in an untrusted environment,
    inheriting the confidentiality and integrity guarantees from the security
    backend, i.e., the underlying enclave technology.
+   Ready-to-use containers, an open source API, libraries, and tools so you can
    develop and run applications that use one or more enclaves.
+   A choice of security backends.
+   Portability of your application's source code across security backends.

This is the initial release of Asylo. We want to expand Asylo's capabilities to
meet more developers' needs. To do this, we plan to add support for more
backends, libraries, and languages.
