The Asylo Team is excited to announce the inaugural release of the
[Asylo framework]({{home}}/about/about.html). Asylo makes it easy to build
enclave applications targeting a variety of emerging trusted execution
environments from existing code. Asylo applications can be ported between
enclave technologies without source-code changes.

The ability to write trustworthy, portable applications that can execute
securely in a variety of environments is important to the integrity and mobility
of sensitive applications. The open source Asylo framework can significantly
advance the state-of-the-art in application security through the transparency,
scrutiny, and collaboration afforded by open development. We are looking forward
to embarking on this fascinating journey with you!
